                    I am a creative person with a passion for learning about any subject. 
                    My studies do not represent the curiosity that I feel; I would like to be training every day for the simple fact of learning and improving. 
                    Search engine for innovative and optimized solutions. Excited to be in the implementation phase of my new career as a web developer. 
                    I am ambitious, adventurous, assiduous, lively. I have made web pages for several people as a freelance using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. 
                    I have managed a database with MySQL and learned the use of the PL/SQL language. 
                    I created a basic programming language with C#, played chess in Python, and learned how to create bots for Discord because I always use that app.
